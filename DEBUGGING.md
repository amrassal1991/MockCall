# MockCall Debugging Guide

## Overview
This document provides guidance for debugging the MockCall AI Call Simulator, particularly focusing on the enhanced features and call initialization system.

## Recent Fixes Applied

### Call Initialization Issues
- **Problem**: "New Call" button was not responding
- **Root Cause**: RealTimeQualityFeedback was not properly initialized before CallFlowManager
- **Solution**: Proper initialization order implemented

### Module Import Resolution
- **Problem**: Enhanced feature modules were not loading correctly
- **Solution**: Moved all module imports to main script module for proper timing

## Debugging Features Added

### Console Logging
The application now includes comprehensive console logging:
- New Call button click events
- StartNewCall method execution steps
- CallFlowManager initialization status
- Error handling with detailed messages

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around critical initialization code
- User-friendly error alerts when initialization fails
- Validation checks for required components

## Enhanced Features Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- **ITG (Issue Type Guide)**: 7-category issue classification system
- **LLQ (Line Level Qualification)**: Troubleshooting documentation system
- **System Navigation**: Enhanced navigation buttons and modals
- **Quality Feedback**: Real-time quality analysis panel

### üîç Testing Recommendations
1. Open browser developer console before testing
2. Click "New Call" button and monitor console output
3. Check for any error messages or failed initializations
4. Test all enhanced features (ITG, LLQ buttons)

## Browser Console Commands
```javascript
// Check if enhanced features are loaded
console.log('CallFlowManager:', window.callFlowManager);
console.log('SystemNavigation:', window.systemNavigation);

// Test call initialization manually
app.startNewCall();
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "New Call" button not responding
- **Check**: Browser console for error messages
- **Verify**: All modules are loaded correctly
- **Solution**: Refresh page and check module imports

### Issue: Enhanced features not working
- **Check**: Module import errors in console
- **Verify**: All JavaScript files are accessible
- **Solution**: Check network tab for failed resource loads

## Test Coverage
- Current test coverage: 77.12% (298 tests passing)
- All existing functionality preserved
- Enhanced features tested manually

## Next Steps
1. Test "New Call" functionality with debugging enabled
2. Verify 10-interaction limit system
3. Test enhanced voice quality features
4. Monitor real-time quality feedback system
